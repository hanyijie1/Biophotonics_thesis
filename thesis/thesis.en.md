## Introduction

At present, biophotonics has made significant progress in the fields of medical imaging and tissue analysis. However, the high cost of high-precision optical instruments has limited their widespread application [8]. In recent years, with the development of machine learning technology, image reconstruction and feature extraction methods based on algorithms have gradually attracted attention [2]. Combining traditional optical methods with modern algorithms has become an important direction for reducing costs and improving image quality. In addition, the advantages of deep learning in image inversion and pattern recognition have also brought new research opportunities for biophotonics [4]. In the future, with the improvement of computing power and algorithm optimization, optical imaging methods based on neural networks are expected to maintain high precision while significantly reducing equipment costs, promoting the popularization and application of biophotonics [11].

Optical technology plays a key role in detecting biological structural tissues. Different wavelengths of light have significant differences in their detection capabilities when penetrating biological tissues [7]. Short-wavelength light has strong scattering and absorption in tissues, limiting its deep imaging capabilities; while long-wavelength light has stronger penetration but lower resolution [1]. Traditional methods improve imaging quality by increasing the precision of a single wavelength or using expensive optical instruments, which not only increases research costs but also limits its widespread application in practice [8]. This study proposes a new research idea: using complex, relatively poor, and unevenly distributed optical instruments, through advanced algorithm fitting, to infer the structural distribution of biological tissues based solely on the information of emitted and transmitted light [3]. If realized, it will significantly reduce the cost of optical imaging equipment while maintaining high imaging accuracy, which has important application value [9].

This study aims to explore the potential application of low-cost optical instruments in biophotonics, and to achieve accurate prediction of the concentration distribution center of the same medium in biological tissues by combining Monte Carlo simulation and neural network technology [4]. This will not only help reduce the equipment costs of biophotonics research but also provide a new technical means for practical medical imaging [6].

## Basic Theory

The Beer-Lambert law describes the absorption process of light in a medium, and its mathematical expression is:

\[ I(x) = I_0 e^{-N_A k(\omega) c x} \]

where \(I(x)\) is the light intensity at a distance \(x\), \(I_0\) is the incident light intensity, \(N_A\) is Avogadro's constant, \(k(\omega)\) is the extinction coefficient, and \(c\) is the concentration [5]. Although this law is a semi-empirical formula on the surface, its physical significance is profound, originating from the interaction between microscopic particles and photons [6]. In actual systems, the absorption frequency is often not a sharp δ function, but due to molecular interactions, temperature effects, and other factors, the absorption peak broadens, usually described by Lorentzian or Gaussian line shapes [9]. Therefore, the absorption coefficient expression can be rewritten as:

\[ \alpha(\omega) = \frac{2 \pi}{\hbar^2} | H_{k'k}’ |^2 \phi(\omega - \omega_{eg}) \]

where \(\phi(\omega - \omega_{eg})\) is the absorption spectral line shape function. Considering concentration and other constant factors, we have:

\[ ck(\omega) \propto \alpha(\omega) \]

It can be seen that it is difficult to decouple concentration and extinction coefficient. In practical applications, it is difficult to accurately infer the specific concentration distribution of substances in biological tissues based solely on the information of emitted and transmitted light intensity.

Based on the above theoretical analysis, this paper simplifies the research proposition, focusing on the detection of concentration distribution in the same medium, and performs calculations entirely in natural units. The following assumptions were made during the simulation:

* Tissue solutions or sections are assumed to be cubes with a side length of 1 unit to meet the application needs of non-sectioned live bodies.
* The tissue cannot be subdivided within a precision of \(10^{-2}\) to ensure the feasibility of the simulation.
* Only absorption occurs, with no reflection, because reflection in biological tissues usually only accounts for a few percentage points of the incident light energy loss, while absorption has a more significant impact [8].
* Light absorption in the same medium is isotropic, which simplifies the light propagation model.
* The light source uses an exponential probability distribution to simulate randomness.

## Monte Carlo Simulation

This paper uses the Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the propagation and absorption of light in biological tissues [3]. The specific steps include randomly generating several concentration distribution areas of substances and expanding them to the entire tissue model through inflation operations [6]. According to the Beer-Lambert law, calculate the intensity distribution of incident and transmitted light at different wavelengths [5]. Save the simulation results in HDF5 format for subsequent neural network training [4].

Figure 1 represents the tissue concentration distribution under two different conditions. The color bar ranges from purple to yellow, representing different concentration values, where purple represents lower concentration and yellow represents higher concentration.

Figure 2 shows the intensity distribution of incident and emitted light in the X, Y, and Z directions. The upper row of images represents the original incident light intensity, and the lower row of images represents the emitted light intensity after passing through the tissue. The color bar ranges from blue to red, representing changes in light intensity, where blue represents lower light intensity and red represents higher light intensity. By comparing the intensity distribution of the original incident light and the emitted light, the absorption and scattering characteristics of the tissue can be analyzed.

## Neural Network Inversion of Concentration Distribution Center

To achieve the inversion of the concentration distribution center from the light intensity distribution, this paper designs a multi-input multi-output neural network model. The model structure includes an input layer, which includes a concentration vector and six light intensity distribution matrices (the intensity distribution of incident and transmitted light in the X, Y, and Z directions) [4]. Through multiple fully connected network hidden layers that extract features, and an output layer that predicts the three-dimensional coordinates of each concentration distribution center [9]. The model training uses mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function and Adam optimizer for optimization [4]. During training, 20% of the data is used for validation to prevent overfitting [10].

Figure 3 shows the neural network structure used in this study. The network consists of six input layers, each receiving 100-dimensional data. After being processed by the flatten layer, the data is sent into multiple dense layers (Dense) for feature extraction. The output of each branch's dense layer is connected (Concatenate) together to form the final output layer, which is used to predict the concentration distribution center of the same medium in biological tissues.

Figure 4 shows the loss change of the neural network during the training process. The blue curve represents the loss of the training set, and the orange curve represents the loss of the validation set. From the figure, it can be seen that with the increase of training rounds (Epoch), both training loss and validation loss show a downward trend, indicating that the model is continuously learning and optimizing. In the early stage of training, the training loss decreases rapidly, and the validation loss fluctuates in the early stage but then gradually stabilizes and decreases, showing the model's good generalization ability.

Figure 5 shows the comparison between the concentration distribution center predicted by the neural network and the actual known position under three different conditions. In each sub-figure, the blue circle represents the known concentration distribution center position, and the red cross represents the predicted position by the neural network.

From the figure, it can be seen that although the prediction results are generally consistent with the known positions, the predicted positions are relatively more concentrated, indicating that the model may not fully capture the subtle changes in the concentration distribution in some cases. This phenomenon may be due to the model predicting the concentration distribution center in three-dimensional space based on two-dimensional input data, and this mapping process from two-dimensional to three-dimensional itself has a certain complexity and challenge. This involves not only the insufficiency of data dimensions but also the expression ability and feature extraction mechanism of the neural network. The existing model is only based on two-dimensional light intensity distribution information, which may not be sufficient to fully describe the details of the concentration distribution in three-dimensional space. For example, the propagation path of light in the tissue is not only affected by absorption and scattering but is also closely related to the complexity of the internal structure of the tissue. The lack of sufficient data dimensions may prevent the model from capturing complex patterns in the concentration distribution, and the prediction tends to find "average" or "representative" distribution centers, ignoring local minor changes. To improve the accuracy of the prediction, this study proposes the following directions for improvement: **Introducing multi-modal input features**: Future models can combine light intensity distribution data of different wavelengths or multi-dimensional optical property data (such as polarization, time-resolved signals, etc.) to enhance the model's understanding of concentration distribution. For example, different wavelengths of light have different sensitivities to tissue absorption and scattering characteristics, and combining this information can more comprehensively depict the complexity of concentration distribution; integrating multi-task learning: In addition to predicting the concentration distribution center, the model can also predict other related characteristics (such as the variance of light intensity distribution, tissue thickness, etc.) to help the model gain more domain knowledge in multi-task learning, thereby enhancing the performance of the main task.

## Conclusion and Prospect

This study proposes a method for inverting concentration distribution based on Monte Carlo simulation and neural networks, simulating the light intensity distribution under low-cost optical instruments, and using neural networks to predict the concentration distribution center of the same medium in biological tissues [4] [5]. The experimental results show that this method has good generalization ability on both the training set and the test set, verifying its potential in practical applications [3]. Although there are still certain limitations in predicting the details of the concentration distribution, this method is of great significance in reducing the cost of optical instruments and improving imaging efficiency [8].
