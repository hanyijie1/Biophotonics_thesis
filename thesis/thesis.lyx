Biophotonics is increasingly used in medical imaging and biological tissue
 analysis, with a focus on maintaining imaging accuracy while reducing costs.
 This study proposes a concentration distribution inversion method combining
 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and neural networks, aimed at achieving high-preci
sion inversion of concentration distributions in biological tissues using
 low-cost optical instruments through algorithm optimization.
 The study first builds a theoretical model of light absorption based on
 the Beer-Lambert Law and uses MC simulations to map light intensity distributio
ns in different concentration areas

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Biophotonics has made significant progress in fields like medical imaging
 and tissue analysis.
 However, the high cost of precision optical instruments limits their widespread
 use
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Recently, with the advancement of machine learning, image reconstruction
 and feature extraction methods based on algorithms have gained attention
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Integrating traditional optical methods with modern algorithms has become
 an important direction for reducing costs and enhancing imaging quality.
 Moreover, the advantages of deep learning in image inversion and pattern
 recognition also bring new research opportunities to biophotonics

 In the future, as computational power and algorithms improve, neural network-ba
sed optical imaging methods are expected to maintain high accuracy while
 significantly reducing equipment costs, promoting the popularization and

Optical techniques play a crucial role in detecting biological structural
 tissues.
 Different light wavelengths have significantly different detection capabilities
 when penetrating biological tissues
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-7"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Short wavelengths, with strong scattering and absorption, limit their deep
 imaging capabilities; whereas long wavelengths, though more penetrating,
 have lower resolution[1].
 Traditional methods improve imaging quality by either enhancing the precision
 of a single wavelength or using expensive optical instruments, which not
 only increases research costs but also limits their practical applications
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-8"

\end_inset

.
 This study proposes a new approach: using complex, substandard, and unevenly
 distributed optical instruments, and advanced algorithms to infer the structura
l distribution of biological tissues based solely on the information of
 emitted and transmitted light[3].
 If successful, this would greatly reduce the cost of optical imaging equipment
 while maintaining high imaging precision, offering significant practical
 value[9].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research aims to explore the potential application of low-cost optical

Basic Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Beer-Lambert law describes the absorption process of light in a medium,
 and its mathematical expression is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I(x)=I_{0}e^{-N_{A}k(\omega)cx}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $I(x)$
\end_inset

 is the light intensity at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the incident light intensity, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}$
\end_inset

 is Avogadro's constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $k(\omega)$
\end_inset

 is the extinction coefficient, and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the concentration
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-5"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Although this law is a semi-empirical formula on the surface, its physical
 significance is profound, originating from the interaction between microscopic
 particles and photons
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-6"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In actual systems, the absorption frequency is often not a sharp δ function,
 but due to molecular interactions, temperature effects, and other factors,
 the absorption peak broadens, usually described by Lorentzian or Gaussian
 line shapes [9].
 Therefore, the absorption coefficient expression can be rewritten as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha(\omega)=\frac{2\pi}{\hbar^{2}}|H_{k'k}\text{'}|^{2}\phi(\omega-\omega_{eg})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\omega-\omega_{eg})$
\end_inset

 is the absorption spectral line shape function.
 Considering concentration and other constant factors, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ck(\omega)\propto\alpha(\omega)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be seen that it is difficult to decouple concentration and extinction
 coefficient.
 In practical applications, it is difficult to accurately infer the specific
 concentration distribution of substances in biological tissues based solely
 on the information of emitted and transmitted light intensity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the above theoretical analysis, this paper simplifies the research
 proposition, focusing on the detection of concentration distribution in
 the same medium, and performs calculations entirely in natural units.

 The network consists of six input layers, each receiving 100-dimensional
 data.
 After being processed by the flatten layer, the data is sent into multiple
 dense layers (Dense) for feature extraction.
 The output of each branch's dense layer is connected (Concatenate) together
 to form the final output layer, which is used to predict the concentration
 distribution center of the same medium in biological tissues.

 process.
 The blue curve represents the loss of the training set, and the orange
 curve represents the loss of the validation set.
 From the figure, it can be seen that with the increase of training rounds
 (Epoch), both training loss and validation loss show a downward trend,
 indicating that the model is continuously learning and optimizing.
 In the early stage of training, the training loss decreases rapidly, and
 the validation loss fluctuates in the early stage but then gradually stabilizes
 and decreases, showing the model's good generalization ability.

Figure 5 shows the comparison between the concentration distribution center
 predicted by the neural network and the actual known position under three
 different conditions.
 In each sub-figure, the blue circle represents the known concentration
 distribution center position, and the red cross represents the predicted
 position by the neural network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the figure, it can be seen that although the prediction results are
 generally consistent with the known positions, the predicted positions
 are relatively more concentrated, indicating that the model may not fully
 capture the subtle changes in the concentration distribution in some cases.
 This phenomenon may be due to the model predicting the concentration distributi
on center in three-dimensional space based on two-dimensional input data,
 and this mapping process from two-dimensional to three-dimensional itself
 has a certain complexity and challenge.
 This involves not only the insufficiency of data dimensions but also the
 expression ability and feature extraction mechanism of the neural network.
 The existing model is only based on two-dimensional light intensity distributio
n information, which may not be sufficient to fully describe the details
 of the concentration distribution in three-dimensional space.
 For example, the propagation path of light in the tissue is not only affected
 by absorption and scattering but is also closely related to the complexity
 of the internal structure of the tissue.
 The lack of sufficient data dimensions may prevent the model from capturing
 complex patterns in the concentration distribution, and the prediction
 tends to find "average" or "representative" distribution centers, ignoring
 local minor changes.
 To improve the accuracy of the prediction, this study proposes the following
 directions for improvement: Introducing multi-modal input features: Future
 models can combine light intensity distribution data of different wavelengths
 or multi-dimensional optical property data (such as polarization, time-resolved
 signals, etc.) to enhance the model's understanding of concentration distributio
n.
 For example, different wavelengths of light have different sensitivities
 to tissue absorption and scattering characteristics, and combining this
 information can more comprehensively depict the complexity of concentration
 distribution; integrating multi-task learning: In addition to predicting
 the concentration distribution center, the model can also predict other
 related characteristics (such as the variance of light intensity distribution,
 tissue thickness, etc.) to help the model gain more domain knowledge in
 multi-task learning, thereby enhancing the performance of the main task.
